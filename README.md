## Intentional exercise
So I was watching this talk the other day, and it mentioned that intentional exercises are more prevalent in other fields like math or music, than, say programming. (like guitarists practicing their scales). Of course, you have an idea, and you go and code it, and that's that. But it's rare you would just keep practicing writing quick sort over and over. But I do think solving problems on hackerranch or leetcode can be categorized as a form of intentional exercise in programming. And it's usually the quickest way to get familiar with certain data structure or a new language.  

Follow the same spirit (I'm not super interested in leetcode problem at the moment, since I'm not looking for a job), I'll use this repo to keep the problems I will hopefully solve from this [book](https://www.gopl.io).
